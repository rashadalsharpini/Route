Stand For Application Programming Interface
Endpoint: is a URL that represents a resource or function in an API

Types of APIs:
- Restful API
	- not a protocol, url based depend on methods get, post and etc.. 
	- http protocol
	- caching 
	- send same data over and over
- SOAP API
	- protocol, return data in XML format
	- better security
	- complex implementation
	- less performance than restful api
- GraphQL
	- query language
	- more flexible
	- probably single end point
	- real time application: dashboards and chats
	- complex implementation
	- no caching
